  },

    "conversation.41.message2": "Erm... They're real nice, boys! But I'm used to making do in the great outdoors."
  },
  {
    "conversation.41.message3": "But... they're HEATED! *whispers* He doesn't like them, Buck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.41.message4": "The answer is always more amenities!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message1": "Fantastic! What do you think of the new surround sound system, Mr. Bunyan?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message2": "When you put on this bird song, doesn't it feel like you're SURROUNDED by nature?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message3": "But we're already surrounded by nature! Honestly, no need to make a fuss over me. I love it all!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message4": "He got surround sound? What am I, chopped liver?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message1": "Now we're cooking! Mr. Bunyan, what do you think of the new whirlpool tub?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message2": "Well..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message3": "Oh no."
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message4": "It's nice! I just prefer a plunge in the Great Lakes. You ever been? Made them myself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message5": "Chuck, I have an idea for an upgrade... But we're going to need a bucket. A big bucket. And more wagons!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message1": "A-a-achoo! Who planted sunflowers INSIDE my wagon? I'm allergic!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message2": "*whispers* Abort Mission Sunny Side Up, I repeat... abort Mission Sunny Side Up."
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message3": "Roger that, Buck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message4": "Let's keep looking for more wagons! I bet a new idea will just pop up!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message1": "Er... anyone have any idea why Puss in Boots is over at my place?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message2": "He's holed up in my bathroom. Said something about treating himself?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message3": "Come to think of it, he was wearing my robe."
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message4": "Psst... gnomes. I have a few ideas for renovations that might interest you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message5": "Mr. Bunyan will love them! We just need a few more wagons..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message1": "Welcome home! What do you think, Mr. Bunyan? Do you like the new scratching post we included?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message2": "We even added a giant sandbox! Just like you asked for!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message3": "Wow, thanks! I didn't ask for any of that, though."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message4": "What?! Why we ouhgta..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message5": "Chuck, I smell a rat! I think we got swindled by the cat."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message6": "You think Puss in Boots got to the stove?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message1": "YOWL! How dare you humiliate me like this, Princess! No one tugs at my collar!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message2": "Stop loitering at Paul's house, it's not yours! Now, if you're a good Kitty, I'll let you play with some yarn."
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message3": "Ohhh yarn! I do love to... no! Cease with your trickery!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message4": "Think, Chuck! What would a flannel-wearing hero who loves oatmeal want in his house?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message1": "By gum, I've think I've got it! Let's get back to work!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message2": "I love it. It's perfect! How did ya know I needed one of these, gnomes?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message3": "A state-of-the-art bowling alley in your basement?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message4": "No... this cupholder. And in my favorite armchair! There's no place like home, am I right, boys?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message5": "*whispers* I think he means the hole we accidentally cut during renovations."
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message6": "Anything for you, Mr. Bunyan."
  },
  {
    "conversation.50.message1": "Wonderous! I love the smell of fresh coral in the morning."
  },
  {
    "conversation.51.message1": "Now it really feels like home!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.51.message2": "Maybe if we keep digging around for coral we'll find buried treasure?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.52.message1": "Hooray, more coral! I think I need to throw a houswarming party to celebrate. Gnomes, could you help set up?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.52.message2": "Will there be lawn games? We're big on lawns."
  },
  {
    "conversation.53.message1": "What else do we need for my housewarming party? Treats, maybe? Fresh sardines always go over well!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.53.message2": "Finally, someone with taste!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.53.message3": "Hmm... It's too quiet in here. We must fix that!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.54.message1": "Excellent job, gnomes! Just testing out some music for the housewarming party now. What do you think? Isn't it beautiful?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.54.message2": "Is that the sound of something dying?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.54.message3": "No silly, it's the barking of seals at sunrise! So soothing."
  },
  {
    "conversation.55.message1": "There's some sort of growth outside my door... is that supposed to be there?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.55.message2": "Um. That's grass, Princess. It comes pretty standard here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.55.message3": " 'Grass.' What an odd word."
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message1": "Hey Princess, where should we put these gadgets and gizmos and thingamabobs? The new basement?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message2": "What do you think I am, some kind of garbage collector? Recyle them!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message3": "You don't even want the fork? Okay, then..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message4": "Just a few more touches left to make before this home is complete! If only Papa could see me now. Living on land with the humans!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.59.message1": "It's beautiful! It's like Papa always said, a school of fish in the mouth of a whale is two hammerheads waiting to strike!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.59.message2": "*whispers* Does anyone know what that means?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.59.message3": "I love my new land home! This terrible fog can't stop us if we work together!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.60.message1": "Oh... a hairbrush! I know someone quite keen on hair products... can't shut up about them, actually."
  },
  {
    "conversation.60.message2": "Let's find more and find out who!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message1": "Another brush... lovely."
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message2": "You don't sound too happy about that, Princess."
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message3": "No, of course I am! Why wouldn't I be happy about finding more perfect stupid royal combs?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message4": "*whispers* Seems like she's in a bad mood... let's get back to work."
  },
  {
    "conversation.62.message1": "Huzzah! I'm the Lord of Hairbrushes!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.62.message2": "More like the Lord of Hardly Washes! Now back to work."
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message1": "Wow! This one's shiny. And smells great."
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message2": "I don't know. Smells kind of like swamp to me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message3": "Uh... is something wrong, Princess?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message4": "No! Nothing's wrong! Keeping finding combs... if you must."
  },
  {
    "conversation.64.message1": "Chuck, have you noticed our brushes mysteriously disappearing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.64.message2": "You know what they say! Hair today, gone tomorrow..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message1": "How many more of these do we need?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message2": "I'm counting: 32 of the small, 25 with the handle, carry the seven..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message3": "Stop! You're making my head spin. How about you make like an axe and get back to chopping!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message4": "But... I'm a gnome, not an axe..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message1": "Holy cannoli... Princess, have YOU been hoarding the combs?! We found a stash in your living room."
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message2": "I confess! It's me! I've been stealing your brushes!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message3": "I'm shocked! And stunned! Aghast, too!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message4": "I'm so sorry, my gnomish friends... it's just... Well, you'll see why when we finish merging these."
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message1": "Helloooo world! Oh, it's you. Did you finally cave in and accept my makeover offer?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message2": "Those ends need... help."
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message3": "No, actually! We're just here clearing out all this fog and saving the Kingdom, if you haven't noticed!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message4": "Sorry. Haven't. I'm too distracted by all the bad hair I'm seeing."
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message5": "Does she come with an off button?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.68.message1": "An anchor! Oh, how wonderful!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.68.message2": "Perhaps it belongs to a pirate... that would be delightful!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.69.message1": "Yuck! An anchor. I bet it belongs to a dirty pirate."
  },
  {
    "conversation.69.message2": "Excuse you! Pirates are noble caretakers of the sea!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.69.message3": "A mermaid WOULD say that. Go ahead, follow the anchors and find out yourself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.70.message1": "What an elegant anchor! Ah, and it smells just like home."
  },
  {
    "conversation.70.message2": "Or like a dirty scoundrel pirate."
  },
  {
    "conversation.70.message3": "Enough! Surely not everyone feels as you do about pirates. Perhaps we should take a poll?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message1": "This anchor is so beautiful... just like your hair, Rapunzel!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message2": "Do you need something?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message3": "Well... Peter and I are taking a poll. What are your thoughts on pirates?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message4": "Style: good. Puffy sleeves are hot right now. Hygiene: terrible. It's a draw."
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message5": "Hmm. Maybe a few more anchors will help sort this out..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message1": "Doesn't this anchor make you think of pirates?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message2": "Not this particular one, no."
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message3": "Well, whatever. We're taking a poll. Do you like pirates, yes or no?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message4": "Depends. Do they have treasure?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message5": "I'm going to put you down as a 'no'."
  },
  {
    "conversation.73.message1": "So far I have 1 neutral, 1 yes, and 1 raspberry sound on the do-we-like pirates poll. And more anchors!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.73.message2": "I'm just supposed to trust your results? You're a mermaid!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.73.message3": "Rude! Admittedly, some of my cousins haven't always been the nicest to humans..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message1": "Ahoy! To what do I owe this great honor?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message2": "I knew it! It's not a pirate, it's Sinbad!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message3": "Hey! I recognize you. I LOVED your show."
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message4": "What? You must be mistaken. I'm Sinbad the Sailor, the Great Adventurer, Conquerer of the Seas!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message5": "Three capitalized titles? Overkill much?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message1": "You know what would make this work go faster?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message2": "Oh! I know! A TIME MACHINE."
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message3": "No... I call it the Merge 5 Bonus!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message4": "When you merge 5 items, you get a bonus item of the next level!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message5": "Well, it's no time machine. But it sure is faster!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.77.message1": "People tell me I have a sweet tooth... They're not wrong. Let me show you some delicious candy magic!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.78.message1": "Woah! Somebody's been hiding chests in trees."
  },
  {
    "conversation.78.message2": "Let's open it! There might be useful goodies inside."
  },
  {
    "conversation.79.message1": "Let's see what else we can discover!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.79.message2": "Magic is everywhere in the land of EverMerge!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.81.message1": "Surprisingly, these gnomes are fantastic lumberjacks!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.81.message2": "Oh, you're just flattering us! Please... don't let us stop you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.82.message1": "Oh no... candy tree season is over! No matter, there are other delicious ingredients in the land of EverMerge!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.82.message2": "Meowrvelous! Maybe we can find some sardine-growing trees now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.83.message1": "Wheat flowering season is over already?! Time flies when you're having fun!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.83.message2": "I can't WHEAT to see what ingredients we find next!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.84.message1": "Apple picking season is over! I didn't even get to tell my apple joke. Hey Buck, how do you make an apple turnover?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.84.message2": "How?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.84.message3": "Push it down a hill!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.85.message1": "Carrot growing season is over! I wonder what new ingredients we'll find next!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.85.message2": "Can we add cioppino to the menu yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.86.message1": "That's enough stones to start building."
  },
  {
    "conversation.86.message2": "As my friends the Little Pigs always say, go stone or don't go home. Seriously, there might be a wolf around."
  },
  {
    "conversation.87.message1": "A few more stones and this will be a stalwart fortification!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.87.message2": "What about additional escape routes? One can never be too careful."
  },
  {
    "conversation.87.message3": "Erm... we can add some more exits?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.88.message1": "Behold! What do you think, Puss in Boots? We added those emergency exits you asked about. There's even some trap doors!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.88.message2": "Hmm. Perhaps it needs some sort of defense system? Are lasers in the budget?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.88.message3": "Should we be worried?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.89.message1": "So, update on the renovation: we couldn't get the lasers you wanted, but we did put in some scary-looking gargoyles."
  },
  {
    "conversation.89.message2": "Not ideal, but I'll make it work. Every great Kingdom should have an intimidating stone keep! Can we add a moat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.89.message3": "We'll see what we can do..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.90.message1": "Check it out! Waiting on a few permits for the moat install, but we did set up a fishline with some bells around the perimeter..?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.90.message2": "Oh! Bells! I love playing with bells! Ahem, I mean, perfect. Yes, that seems like it should hold up."
  },
  {
    "conversation.90.message3": "Against... what?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.91.message1": "Those flowers are so beautiful! Almost as beautiful as my hair."
  },
  {
    "conversation.92.message1": "Achoo! Are all these flowers necessary? Or maybe it's all the hair products I'm allergic to!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.92.message2": "You know, I have a friend who's allergic to cats. So, like, maybe you're allergic to yourself?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.92.message3": "Hilarious! Well, at least I've never been trapped in a tower by some old grandma!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.93.message1": "Oh, how wonderful! A sweet little drum. I'm sure I've seen this somewhere before."
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message1": "Pa rum pum bop ba! I love a good drum beat, don't you Chuck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message2": "I would believe you if you were drumming to any discernible rhythm."
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message3": "Exsqueeze me? We have rhythm in spades!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message4": "Oh? I bet I can drum better than you. Perhaps this calls for a drum-off?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.95.message1": "Folks, we're gathering more drums for the drum-off! Everyone's invited!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.95.message2": "Lovely! Just like our annual Squid Bounce at home! Admittedly, it was quite a bit more inky."
  },
  {
    "conversation.95.message3": "Something tells me it's not at all like that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message1": "How are you feeling about this drum challenge against the gnomes, Puss in Boots? Training going okay?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message2": "Training? All I need is the rhythm in my bones!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message3": "For I am Puss in Boots, master swordsman and... legendary drummer!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message4": "A cat drumming? I swear I saw a video on the internet about this once."
  },
  {
    "conversation.97.message1": "Great new drums, gnomes! How are you feeling before the big drum-off against Puss in Boots, boys?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.97.message2": "We're feeling strong! Limber! Raring to go!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.97.message3": "And we're building a team of the best drums behind us! These drums are giving it 110 percent!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message1": "All right, folks... Welcome to EverMerge's first-ever drumming battle!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message2": "In one corner we have... Puss in Boots! He once put on a pair of boots, the rest is history!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message3": "In the other corner... our favorite gnomes! Three-time tree-chopping EverMerge champions!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message4": "Let's have a good, clean, drum-off. Ready everyone?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.99.message1": "We're in the middle of the drumming challenge, folks! The drums are getting bigger and louder!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.99.message2": "Wait a second... I'm hearing that our participants have just gotten a bad arm cramp."
  },
  {
    "conversation.99.message3": "They're checking the tapes... It's a tie between Puss in Boots and the gnomes! Maybe our special guest will weigh in?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.100.message1": "What's with all the banging drums? Can't a boy be stuck in cursed fog in peace?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.100.message2": "You missed one heck of a drum-off!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.100.message3": "We're going to need more of your drums, kid. A rematch is in order!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.100.message4": "I'd love to stick around to see how it all plays out, but I've got an appointment to not care about this later."
  },
  {
    "conversation.101.message1": "WOW! These shoes are cute as a button!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.102.message1": "Oh my FOG, more shoes! Is this a dream come true?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.102.message2": "I need to find this shoemaker ASAP. I want a custom design!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.103.message1": "This shoe has some seriously talented stitch work..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.103.message2": "Oh, it says it right on the package: mousepawmade with love. I know mouse stiches when I see them!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.104.message1": "Take a whiff of this shoe, what do you smell?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.104.message2": "You want me to smell someone's shoe? How exciting! What a thrilling land custom."
  },
  {
    "conversation.104.message3": "It smells like fresh pumpkin doesn't it? Totally weird. But it totally works."
  },
  {
    "conversation.105.message1": "There are traces of fairy godmother dust on this shoe!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.105.message2": "Is that good?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.105.message3": "Is that good?! You're kidding, right? It's all the rage now."
  },
  {
    "conversation.106.message1": "Wow! Are the jewels on this shoe beak-fastened by sparrows?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.106.message2": "How can you even tell?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.106.message3": "It's obvious!! It's so hard to be the only person with good taste for miles."
  },
  {
    "conversation.107.message1": "There's a little soot on this shoe... no matter! A little makeup remover and it's as good as new!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.107.message2": "What are you doing with all those shoes?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.107.message3": "None of your beeswax, Princess! Get your own shoes!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.108.message1": "What time is it? Is it midnight yet?! I've got to get going!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.108.message2": "Wait! Did you design these shoes? I mean, I expected someone more impressive, but hey! I'll make it work."
  },
  {
    "conversation.108.message3": "Ex...excuse me?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.108.message4": "I want a custom design. I'm thinking the best material will be my own hair. You see, it's extremely beautiful and sturdy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.109.message1": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall - but which wall to put it on? Decorating is so hard."
  },
  {
    "conversation.110.message1": "Wow! Looks just like a talking mirror I once knew."
  },
  {
    "conversation.110.message2": "That gives me an idea. I just need to find another mirror..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message1": "Haha! Wow! You're so funny, mirror."
  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message2": "Are you... talking to that mirror?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message3": "Why, yes! It's a magic mirror, obviously. What? You don't speak mirror?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message4": "Of course I do! I'm just... rusty. So, what is it saying, then? Anything good?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message5": "Says fame and fortune awaits you! But only if you start giving back. Got any extra coin?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.112.message1": "Here comes Rapunzel! This'll be good... Hey! I've got a message from this mirror to deliver."

    "conversation.139.message1": "Welcome to the first official sleepover at Red's house!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.139.message2": "How marvelous! What games shall we play? Swing the Jellyfish was always a childhood favorite."

  {
    "conversation.139.message3": "Uh... how about Truth or Dare? You'll both love it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message1": "Okay, Red, time to celebrate your new place! Ready to play your first Truth or Dare? It's the perfect sleepover fare."
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message2": "*gulp* Yes... um, dare?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message3": "I dare you to... put chocolate syrup on a pickle and eat it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message4": "WHAT?! I could never! Grandmother always said no sweets after 7pm. And never on a pickle!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message1": "All right, I think I understand how to play this 'Truth or Dare' game now..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message2": "Red, I dare you to... go outside and do the Kraken Crawl!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message3": "Mermaid, nobody's ever heard of that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message4": "Also, I could NEVER! Grandmother says dancing is for ding-dongs trying to sell you something."
  },
  {
    "conversation.142.message1": "Okay, let's keep this sleepover on track! We have GOT to find a dare you can do, Red. Hmm..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.142.message2": "I dare you to... put used dishes in the sink without rinsing them first?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.142.message3": "ARE YOU INSANE? Grandmother says that's how you ruin a dish! You always rinse!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.143.message1": "*whispers* Between you and me, this sleepover with Red isn't going so well."
  },
  {
    "conversation.143.message2": "Is this not what all sleepovers on land are like? Is it time to play Sharks and Whales yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message1": "Red, we've whittled down all the dares you won't do because of your Grandmother... so let's try something new!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message2": "I dare you to... not listen to your Grandmother for once!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message3": "I don't understand the dare. Is this a joke?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message4": "Oh for fog's sake..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message1": "Forget Truth or Dare. Your new house is tailormade to you! What about we just make friendship bracelets to celebrate?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message2": "Well... Grandmother does always say a woman's hand is what holds together the world!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message3": "So, I think she'd like it if we decorated them!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message4": "Finally! Now you can really settle into this place!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.147.message1": "Achoo! We can't go on like this! Your flowers are going to be the death of me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.147.message2": "You have 8 other lives, don't you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.147.message3": "Why I oughta..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message1": "Ohhh! The flowers around here totally remind me of a bouquet I once put together for Beast."
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message2": "For Beauty? How lovely!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message3": "You'd think! He just kept going on and on about roses. Roses this, roses that, blah blah blah. Like, there's all kinds of flowers out there you know?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message4": "I heard Beauty doesn't even LIKE roses..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.149.message1": "What do you think of my renovations, Paul? Don't you just LOVE my new yoga studio?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.149.message2": "Err... you betcha. Seems real peaceful in here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.149.message3": "Like I always say, got to keep your mind, body, and spirit cleansed. Also, limber enough to climb down a tower."
  },
  {
    "conversation.150.message1": "Rapunzel, I was looking at the blueprints for the place... you're sure you wanted an 'all charcoal room' added?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.150.message2": "Duh! Charcoal is a detoxifier. Can't you just feel the toxins flowing right out of you when you walk in?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.150.message3": "*whispers* Buck, what does a toxin look like?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.151.message1": "Oh, hello Sleeping Beauty. Funny you should stop by. The gnomes just installed the hair salon, finally going to let me give that 'do a whirl?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.151.message2": "What's so wrong with my hair?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.151.message3": "If you have to ask..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message1": "Check it out, everyone! This is where the MAGIC happens... my studio. The lighting in here is great, right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message2": "Rapunzel, none of the photos you're showing us look anything like you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message3": "Excuse me? My 1.2 million followers would disagree with you. People LOVE my hair inspiration posts!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message4": "It's true, I've gotten some great beard tips."
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message1": "Puss in Boots?! Is that you? You're so... fluffy! And polished?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message2": "It sure is! AND he smells like Bouquet of Towers. It's my signature scent, too."
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message3": "She tricked me into a makeover! You might have won the battle, Princess Hairspray, but the war is still ahead..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message4": "Yeah, whatever. On that note, my place is officially open for makeover montages! Any takers?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.154.message1": "Canvas rolls! Perfect. A few more of these and I can start building my tent up again."
  },

    "conversation.155.message1": "There's only one thing that could make this place better: Charging admission!"

    "conversation.155.message2": "Attention EverMerge residents: come one, come all! Pinocchio's Amazing Circus of Fear is open!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.155.message3": "Do you dare enter and reveal your biggest fear?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message1": "The Circus of Fear seems scary, but... I've got a basket to deliver, and it's the fastest route through!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message2": "AHHHH!!! Make it stop!!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message3": "Your biggest fear... is your Grandmother? I thought it was wolves?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message4": "You've never seen Grandmother when she's watching her stories and gets interrupted."
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message1": "A circus tent! How quaint."
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message2": "It's not just any circus... it's the Amazing Circus of Fear! Step right up. What do you see?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message3": "Oh my fog!!! It's me, but I don't have legs!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message4": "*whispers* Seriously, should someone tell her?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message1": "Paul Bunyan! Do you dare enter the Amazing Circus of Fear?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message2": "Oh jeez, well I was just passing through, but I'll take a gander!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message3": "UFF DA! SPIDERS!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message4": "Really? But they're so... tiny."
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message5": "With four times the number of legs!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message1": "Welcome to the Circus of Fear, Sleeping Beauty! Do you dare enter?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message2": "Circus of what now? Well, I suppose! Why not? You seem very proud of it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message3": "AHHH!!! It's an office kitchen. But there's only one coffee machine for everyone to share..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message4": "Worst of all, it's DECAF."
  },
  {
    "conversation.160.message1": "A circus! Nice. Do you have those motorcycles that jump through hoops of fire? I'm into those."
  },
  {
    "conversation.160.message2": "Er... not exactly. See for yourself! If you dare..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.160.message3": "WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FOG. What kind of sick person would have a room full of tax returns?! I'm out of here!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message1": "Sleeping Beauty? Our team's heard you've been trying to take down the Circus of Fear."
  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message2": "We all want our money back! You tricked us!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message3": "Sorry to say you are officially served with a cease and desist for defamational word choices against Pinocchio, see Section 3B of EverMerge world policy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message4": "What? Is that a thing? You're working for Pinocchio??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message5": "What can I say? The Circus of Fear is a lucrative gig, and business is booming!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.164.message1": "The Circus of Fear is unstoppable! How will we ever fight against it?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.164.message2": "There's only one way we're going to get through this one, and it's a tale as old as time."
  },
  {
    "conversation.164.message3": "Oh! We're getting the Beast to go intimidate Pinocchio?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.164.message4": "No! We're going to march right in there and face our fears!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.165.message1": "These stones are big enough to start building my lighthouse! Every island needs one."
  },
  {
    "conversation.166.message1": "Ah, our work on this lighthouse reminds me of the time I shipwrecked off the coast of Bali."
  },
  {
    "conversation.166.message2": "I ate nothing but coconuts to survive, until a large raven offered to take me home in exchange for one of my rings."
  },
  {
    "conversation.166.message3": "Wow! A raven? Really?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.167.message1": "A few more merges and we'll be up and running in no time!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.167.message2": "Reminds me of the time I was shipwrecked in the Caribbean with only a matchbook and my sheer will."
  },
  {
    "conversation.167.message3": "Well, that and the pod of dolphins that offered to help."
  },
  {
    "conversation.168.message1": "What a lighthouse! Though it lacks in finery still, it does have such a beautiful view of the sea..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.168.message2": "It reminds me of the time I shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean. I landed on an island of man-eating gorillas, and..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.168.message3": "WHAT?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.169.message1": "Ah, that salty sea air! What a day to build! Ah, it reminds me of the time I was shipwrecked against the Cliffs of Moher."
  },
  {
    "conversation.169.message2": "Had it not been for the giant snakes that ate my captors, well, who knows how long I'd have been there!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.169.message3": "Is this... for real?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.169.message4": "What, cursed fog is believable but giant snakes aren't?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.170.message1": "Sinbad seems like he's settling into his new place! He sure seems to talk about getting shipwrecked a lot, though. For a sailor, that seems odd."
  },
  {
    "conversation.170.message2": "The Ocean Kingdom has watched all of them! The one with the iceberg was certainly dramatic."
  },
  {
    "conversation.170.message3": "You'd watch his shipwrecks?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.170.message4": "Of course! Season two was really my favorite, though. Then they got a bit derivative."
  },
  {
    "conversation.171.message1": "Wow! I love the new expansion on the place, Sinbad. The gnomes are doing some fine work!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.171.message2": "They're such good listeners, too! I was just regaling them with the story of my latest shipwreck, it was on the small island of..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.171.message3": "Wait. Before you go on, exactly how many times have you shipwrecked?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.171.message4": "Who can keep track of such things?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.172.message1": "Oh - greetings, everyone! What are we all doing at my place? Coming to see the new aquarium?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.172.message2": "Sinbad, we're worried about you. You keep shipwrecking and we want to make sure you're safe. We all came together and signed you up for sailing lessons."
  },
  {
    "conversation.172.message3": "ME? Sailing lessons?! How dare you insult me! Who would dare to teach Sinbad, Conqueror of the Seas, sailing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.172.message4": "Erm... that'd be me. I do a little bit of sailing myself!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.173.message1": "How are the sailing lessons with Sinbad going?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.173.message2": "Well, we started by covering sailing knots... but then he got himself tangled, somehow took down a sail, and we shipwrecked."
  },
  {
    "conversation.173.message3": "I don't know how much I can help."
  },
  {
    "conversation.174.message1": "I would like to announce my sailing lessons are over. Paul and I have decided to amicably part ways."
  },
  {
    "conversation.174.message2": "But no matter! My new lighthouse has plenty of space for all of my sailing equipment. I will sail again yet!"
  },

    "conversation.174.message3": "*whispers* So you quit, huh?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.174.message4": "You betcha."
  },
  {
    "conversation.175.message1": "Apple pies, apple tarts, apple fritters... think of all the delicious apple recipes we could make!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.175.message2": "Let's get more so we can start an orchard!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.176.message1": "Carrots? HIYAH!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.176.message2": "What are you doing, Chuck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.176.message3": "Practicing my carrot-e... I'm a yellow belt."
  },
  {
    "conversation.177.message1": "Mushrooms! Remember that mushroom car I once owned?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.177.message2": "It wasn't pretty, but it sure made a nice shroom shroom sound."
  },
  {
    "conversation.178.message1": "Corn-gratulations! The more corn we gather, the closer we are to harvesting!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.179.message1": "Mmm... mangos. Help me collect more so we can harvest them for smoothies!"
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message2": "Uh... yeah?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message3": "As you can see, the grass is quite overrun. The gnomes left a mower right over there. Would you be a dear?"

  {
    "conversation.219.message4": "What? You expect me to mow your lawn, lady?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message5": "Don't you be fresh with ME, Peter! Now get to it. There's only so many hours in the day and we need to keep building!"

  },
  {
    "conversation.220.message3": "Did I hurt THEM? I almost lost a finger!"
  },

    "conversation.221.message3": "Frog legs? Ah. I uh, I'm more of a vegetarian myself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.221.message4": "Oh? My guests say it's hoppin' good."
  },
  {
    "conversation.222.message1": "What's that land plant you're growing in your garden, Thumbelina? The berries look delicious!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.222.message2": "Ah! I wouldn't eat those if I were you, dearie. They're poisonous unless mixed with a little chamomile. Want me to fix you a cup?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.222.message3": "Er... no thank you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message1": "Dearies, you've done such a wonderful job with the house! Now..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message2": "Hmm, did someone *eye twitches* rearrange the vegetable patch?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message3": "S-shouldn't the carrots go with the cauliflower? It's alphabetical order!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message4": "NO YOU IDIO... *deep breath* Nevermind that. We all make mistakes! Some of us more than others... Let's get this fixed!"

  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message3": "No, silly - spring is in the air! And I've thought up the perfect way to celebrate!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message4": "We're finally getting that axe display case installed in the break room?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message5": "No... wait, what? We're going to merge our way to a very special springtime tree!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.306.message1": "Hello there, fog-fighter! It's so nice to meet you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.306.message2": "I was just on the beach, reminiscing on all the wonderful parties we used to have in the Ocean Kingdom..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.306.message3": "With a little help, I can throw one for my friends in EverMerge! Tropical flowers... sand castles... it would be so much fun! What do you say?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.229.message1": "Now what do we have here...? A wizard's hat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.229.message2": "I wonder if there's some way to harness its magic... Hmmm, maybe I can build an app for that!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message1": "Ouch! This ugly hat just zapped me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message2": "*snickers* You didn't know about the alarm system? It's magical. Genius, actually."
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message3": "I'm guessing its owner didn't want anyone else's grubby hands on it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message4": "Excuse me, puppet boy! I wouldn't be caught dead in this thing, anyway! It's WAY out of style. And smells a bit like old books."
  },
  {
    "conversation.231.message1": "Ooo... is this a magician's hat?! Maybe there's a fuzzy wuzzy rabbit inside!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.231.message2": "Mrrreeow! *hiss* Who dares to disturb me?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.231.message3": "AHH!! Oh, it's you. You're not a rabbit! What are you doing in that hat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.231.message4": "No, I am obviously NOT a rabbit. I am also certainly not fuzzy or wuzzy! I was, however, curling up for a nap. Now, scram!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.231.message5": "*mutters* Hmph, well you're kind of fuzzy and wuzzy... and grumpy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.232.message1": "Get that thing away from me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.232.message2": "Get what away from you, m'am...?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.232.message3": "That hat! It's magical! Magic and I DO NOT mix well. Quick, I think it senses my fear!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.232.message4": "*whispers* She's still getting over that whole apple thing, huh? Don't we have rules in place about that kind of stuff now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.232.message5": "Hmm... or maybe it was magic lamps we're not allowed to manufacture anymore..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.233.message1": "Oh, hey! It's one of these things. Those hats that come with a GPS."
  },
  {
    "conversation.233.message2": "I've heard of this! It's a navigation system that humans use, correct? Seems unnecessary when you can just follow a current."
  },
  {
    "conversation.233.message3": "No... a Guaranteed Potions System. It doubles as a potions dispenser."
  },
  {
    "conversation.234.message1": "Dearie, is something wrong? You look downright unnerved."
  },
  {
    "conversation.234.message2": "I never thought I'd see one of these things again. A hat forged in the fires of Mt. Calamity... shaped by the dark flame of vengeance... It must be destroyed."
  },
  {
    "conversation.234.message3": "Um... care to elaborate? I'm sure we can solve this over a spot of tea."
  },
  {
    "conversation.234.message4": "*thousand-yard stare* It curses those who wear it into thinking prequel trilogies are a good idea."
  },
  {
    "conversation.234.message5": "*gasp* No, it can't be!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.235.message1": "AHHH! Another magical hat! Is it following me??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.235.message2": "You're asking if the inanimate object is following you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.235.message3": "I swear I just put one of these hats away, and more just keep popping up! They KNOW I don't like magic! They're mocking me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.235.message4": "Oh dear... Gnomes, can we clean up these hats? They're upsetting Snow."
  },
  {
    "conversation.236.message1": "Ah, perfect! Another hat. Now I can put my app to the test."
  },
  {
    "conversation.236.message2": "What app is that?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.236.message3": "MagicNet: Harness the power outside yourself, within. Catchy, right? No use letting all the magic in these hats go to waste! Okay... prepare to be amazed!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.236.message4": "*crickets* Should something be happening?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.236.message5": "Ah, ahem, maybe some modifications are in order..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.237.message1": "Peter, why are you shaking that hat? Did it do something to you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.237.message2": "Listen lady, I haven't been flying much since EverMerge went fog-crazy. There has to be some fairy dust in this thing... it's magical!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.237.message3": "Well, did you find any?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.237.message4": "No, but weirdly enough a sword in a big stone popped out. Sword will not come out of the stone, though. I already tried."
  },
  {
    "conversation.238.message1": "Oh dear! There's some dust on that hat. We've better get that out... ah, yes, there we go. Much better!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.238.message2": "We can't have our EverMerge looking like a junkyard now, can we? Not if we're trying to be up with the times!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.238.message3": "Now, I wonder if we can do anything about that smell..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message1": "Merlin! Oh, we're so glad you're back. We've been in dire need of a wizard of your talents!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message2": "Say, Mr. Merlin, sir - where's your hat? They were all over the place!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message3": "What kind of idiotic question is that? It's on my head!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message4": "Er... where, exactly?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message5": "*sigh* It's invisible. How many times must I explain? Invisible hats are the strongest for channeling magic. Every alchemist worth his salt knows this."
  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message6": "Now, I hope everyone's been dutifully gathering data during this fog incident. I'll need it for my analysis."
  },
  {
    "conversation.240.message1": "Oh, something new! What is that, my gnomish friends?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.240.message2": "You like? It's a CASTLE FOUNDATION. You see, every building needs the right foundation to grow big and strong!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.240.message3": "Let's keep chopping, soon we'll have enough Wood buildings to merge up to a Castle!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.241.message1": "Is that an... apple hut?! That's one way to get over your fears, Snow!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.241.message2": "Trust me, I don't like it, either. But it's the safest building material!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.241.message3": "The only way to protect yourself against poisonous apples is to fight fire with fire! Or, uh, apple with apple..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.242.message1": "What is it that they say, Buck? An apple a day keeps the doctor away?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.242.message2": "Unless it's poisonous, Chuck... then you should dial one immediately."
  },
  {
    "conversation.243.message1": "Uh... where are all the mirrors in this house? Like, how do you even know if you're camera ready?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.243.message2": "No mirrors allowed. At all. Last time a mirror had an opinion on me, it didn't turn out well."
  },
  {
    "conversation.244.message1": "Hey, Snow, blueprints say you need four bathrooms? That right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.244.message2": "At minimum. I have seven roommates and we've already tried the whole one-bathroom thing. It wasn't pretty."
  },
  {
    "conversation.245.message1": "Uh, Snow? Anyone home?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.245.message2": "*peeks through curtains* Who are you? What are you holding?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.245.message3": "It's a hot dish! Just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.245.message4": "You look... woodsy. You're not a huntsman, are you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.245.message5": "Erm..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.246.message1": "I love the new chore board in the kitchen!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.246.message2": "We've had to work up to sharing house duties. It just doesn't make sense for one woman to clean up after SEVEN other folks!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.246.message3": "Just doing the socks used to take all day..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.247.message1": "Hello, Snow?! I've been knocking for ages! Maybe I could ask the gnomes to install a doorbell?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.247.message2": "Oh no, no, no. A certain seven someones don't want one installed..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.247.message3": "They say I keep letting in, 'The Evil Queen disguised as strangers bearing gifts trying to kill you.'"
  },
  {

  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.248.message2": "What are you doing, Chuck?"

  {
    "conversation.248.message3": "Just making sure there's enough coat hooks for the whole house! Shoot. Now I have to start counting over..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.248.message4": "Oh, brother... just mark the wall and install, Chuck!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.253.message1": "Anyone seen Sinbad? I have a bone to pick with him about the house alarm system he sold me! It's a piece of..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.253.message2": "Shhh! I'm looking for him too and don't want to scare him off!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.253.message3": "I bought a faulty set of loaded dice from him just last week. What's the world come to when you can't trust a guy to help you cheat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.254.message1": "Aaaaaaaand... we're done! What do ya think, Snow? Gotta say, this was a tough job. Eight of everything all over the house!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.254.message2": "It's perfect, gnomes! Now we can start a whole new chapter in EverMerge... with a higher-end security system and equitable chore-sharing!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.254.message3": "Now that's what I call modern amenities."
  },
  {
    "conversation.255.message1": "Look! A magical apple mine!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.255.message2": "Do you think it comes with caramel? Mmm.... caramel apples sound delicious."
  },
  {
    "conversation.255.message3": "No, Chuck, stop trying to eat the mine! This one's for BUILDING. Go ahead, see for yourself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.256.message1": "There's so much left to do... how will I ever get my house up and running in time to release this new design?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.256.message2": "Don't worry. You've got us on the job now, Cinderella!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.256.message3": "Yeah! And we already have some ideas for improvements."
  },
  {
    "conversation.257.message1": "This pumpkin patch in the yard only has one pumpkin. Is that right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.257.message2": "Why, yes! You only need one pumpkin a year to be big enough for the ball, of course."
  },
  {
    "conversation.257.message3": "*mutters* Seems like a lot's riding on that one pumpkin holding up... Plus, what about pies?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.257.message4": "The client's always right, Chuck. But I'm with you... not enough pie is a shame any way you slice it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.258.message1": "AHHH! Did you see that? Something under the rug moved!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.258.message2": "The mice, you mean? They live here, silly! Honestly, have you ever tried to finish a gown without them?"
  },

    "conversation.259.message1": "Looking at the blueprints... says you need an 'infinity' sized shoe closet. Is that right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.259.message2": "Yes, it should be quite large. Larger than the human mind is capable of understanding, even..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.259.message3": "Ooookay. I'll put Chuck in charge of that. He specializes in not being capable of understanding."
  },
  {
    "conversation.260.message1": "Oh! It's perfect. Can you put that right over there, maybe near the pumpkin patch?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.260.message2": "Sure thing, Princess. Uh... what IS it, by the way? Making pizzas later?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.260.message3": "A glass-blowing oven! After the last time my shoe went missing, I just thought..."
  },

    "conversation.262.message1": "Oh, hello Puss in Boots! How are you? I'm just working on my new des...."
  },
  {
    "conversation.262.message2": "About that. I've been thinking your new design needs to be premiered in a big way. Hasn't press been pretty so-so?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.262.message3": "Well, I suppose so... but with the fog and everything I..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.262.message4": "Perfect. Leave the launch party to me! I'll just take a small fee for putting it all together."
  },

    "conversation.263.message1": "Cinderella, we installed a new gallery. Thought some of those shoes could use some time to shine!"

  },
  {
    "conversation.269.message1": "Gather around, everyone! Cinderella's about to release her newest design! Any words? (I'll take my fee after the party.)"
  },

    "conversation.269.message2": "Well, I just want to say, thank you all for coming. I'm so glad to celebrate shoes with you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.269.message3": "Shoes keep all our toes safe and sound. They take us places. And they bring us together! I hope you enjoy this one."
  },
  {
    "conversation.269.message4": "*whispers* Buck, what am I looking at?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.269.message5": "I'm not sure... It's like a butterfly eating a sandwich..."

  {
    "conversation.270.message1": "There's much of my lab left to rebuild, and my powers haven't been the same with this fog around..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.270.message2": "No worries, Mr. Merlin, sir! We'll help!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.270.message3": "Excellent, we'll need to work as efficiently as possible to get all my experiments up and running again."

    "conversation.272.message1": "Merlin, if you're not too busy moving in, I've got a quandary I need solving..."
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.272.message3": "I need a rubber strap that will work with this slingshot."

  },
  {
    "conversation.274.message1": "Merlin, I was told you might have a hat somewhere that would reveal my inner self? Like, tell me if I was brave?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.274.message2": "That's ludicrous, a hat could never do that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.274.message3": "Well, is there like, a potion or something?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.274.message4": "Let me get back to you. I have some researching to do."
  },
  {
    "conversation.275.message1": "Hi Merlin! Oh, what's this?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.275.message2": "Well, you desired to know your inner self, did you not? I've come up with a solution that does not involve wearing any silly talking hats."
  },
  {
    "conversation.275.message3": "All you must do is answer this brief questionnaire."
  },
  {
    "conversation.275.message4": "So, like, a... personality quiz?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.276.message1": "Mr. Merlin, sir, can you help us?! We were putting the finishing touches on your potions room and..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.276.message2": "Puss in Boots got into your potions! He's in there now, half centaur half cat!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.276.message3": "Stars above... How many times have I told that cat not to dip into my potions?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.276.message4": "*whispers* We can't let the board find out about this one, Chuck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.277.message1": "Has anyone seen Puss in Boots?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.277.message2": "Uh... he's feeling a little mixed up right now."
  },
  {
    "conversation.277.message3": "Yeah, he got into Merlin's potions room and now he's half centaur."
  },
  {
    "conversation.277.message4": "Really grumpy about it, too. We keep telling him to rein in his attitude..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.278.message1": "I see you're back to being full cat and not half centaur... I take it Merlin fixed you. Now, what did we learn?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.278.message2": "If Merlin didn't want people to peruse his potions collection, he should put a lock on the door."
  },
  {
    "conversation.278.message3": "He did..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.279.message1": "Oh, what a lovely parrot you have! I do so love land creatures. What's its name?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.279.message2": "Aurelius, and he's a thorn in my side. *SqwwAAK* Shush up! You've been fed today!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.279.message3": "*whispers* Wasn't that his brother's name?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.282.message1": "Let's go over the build list. Lab? Check. Menagerie? Check. That one room with all the spiky stuff? Check."
  },
  {
    "conversation.282.message2": "Don't forget the lava pools and the disintegration room."
  },
  {
    "conversation.282.message3": "Right, right... oh! How could we forget?! We haven't installed a garage!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.283.message1": "Excellent work, gnomes. You have proven yourselves to be not useless."
  },
  {
    "conversation.283.message2": "Now, have either of you considered a position as a lab assistant? I have some ideas..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.283.message3": "Er... Not sure the union would go for that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.284.message1": "Curious... Peter, is this your sword? Can you pick up after yourself? We're trying to tidy up the place, not make it pokier."
  },
  {
    "conversation.284.message2": "Hey, that's not my mess! Not my sword, either."
  },
  {
    "conversation.284.message3": "Hmm... Who must it belong to, then?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.285.message1": "Sinbad, surely you must have seen swords like this on your adventures? Any bells ringing on an owner?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.285.message2": "Yes... I did run into a great many beautiful weapons such as this. I never did get a close look, though."
  },
  {
    "conversation.285.message3": "Ogres, giants, and trolls are protective of their spoils. And surprisingly quick on their feet..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.286.message1": "Yes, this is perfect. Good balance on this sword. Light, but sturdy. Not too fussy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.286.message2": "Perfect for what, Snow?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.286.message3": "For predators, obviously! What, you're just going to walk around in the woods defenseless?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.286.message4": "Uh... Was I not supposed to be doing that?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.287.message1": "What a sword! Fit enough for a master swordsman, one of the highest caliber. Like, say, myself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.287.message2": "*snorts* You, a master sworsdman? Sure, Fluffy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.287.message3": "Fluffy?! I'll show you where to put a sword! En garde!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.287.message4": "Easy, boys. We need all hands on deck, and attached to their bodies, to make it out of this fog."
  },
  {
    "conversation.288.message1": "Uh... hi Peter. Cool sword! Hey, Puss in Boots asked me to deliver this letter to you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.288.message2": "Why doesn't he just send an email? I keep telling him I'll teach him how..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.288.message3": "Huh, it's a note challenging me to a duel. Hmm... If I livestream it, it might be good for my views."
  },
  {
    "conversation.289.message1": "I see you've chosen to show your face at our duel, Peter Panfry! Prepare to hover for the last time. En garde!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.289.message2": "Please, I once took on Captain Hook with a toothpick and a pound of glue. I can take you with a fancy sword, Fluffball."
  },
  {
    "conversation.289.message3": "Are you filming this? I don't want to be on your stupid channel! I demand royalties!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.290.message1": "Oh oh oh!!! Have you seen this sword?! It's positively magical."
  },
  {
    "conversation.290.message2": "What's got your tail in a twist, Mermaid?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.290.message3": "If this belongs to who I think it does... we're in for a real treat! Her skills on the battlefield are legendary... even in the Ocean Kingdom!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.291.message1": "WATCH OUT!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.291.message2": "Wow, way to kill a caffeine buzz... what's wrong now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.291.message3": "That sword! Didn't you see that episode of All My Trolls where the sword comes to life and tries to off its owner to take over his LIFE?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.291.message4": "Um... no. No I did not."
  },
  {
    "conversation.292.message1": "Wow... this sword's design is so beautiful. Maybe I can model a shoe inspired by it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.292.message2": "That's a great idea! I can help market it. Let's talk taglines... how about: 'A heel so sharp it can slice cheese!'"
  },
  {
    "conversation.292.message3": "I see a market opportunity in specialty shoes for picnics and parties."
  },
  {
    "conversation.293.message1": "Magnificent. Is this adamantine steel? If I melt it down, I might be able to..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.293.message2": "Melt it DOWN??? We could never destroy such an amazing relic!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.293.message3": "A relic is by definition an object that no longer has any use. If I melt it, it'll be useful. Hence, melting."
  },
  {
    "conversation.294.message1": "OH MY SEA STARS!! In all the oceans, I never thought I'd meet you! Welcome, Mulan!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.294.message2": "Uh... hi! Thanks for the wake-up, everyone. This whole fog thing really put a dent in my training schedule..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.294.message3": "*whispers* Did you hear that? She's thanking US."
  },
  {
    "conversation.294.message4": "Quick question. Who melted one of my swords?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.295.message1": "Curious and curiouser..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.295.message2": "What's curious??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.295.message3": "This clock! Something's off about it. I say we find more to make sure nothing squirrely's going on here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.296.message1": "You two look very interested in something... what's going on? I hope it's not another one of Pandora's boxes... We don't want a repeat!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.296.message2": "It's the clocks, Princess! Have you noticed how they're ticking backwards?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.296.message3": "I think I watched it go sideways once. It's a bunch of nonsense!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.296.message4": "We need to collect more data! I'll get a binder started. Yes, it will be color-coded."
  },
  {
    "conversation.297.message1": "Oh, perfect! A clock. I was just looking for one to time my sprints."
  },
  {
    "conversation.297.message2": "Careful, Mulan! I don't think you wanna use that clock. Something weird's going on with it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.297.message3": "Uh... okay. What kind of weird exactly?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.297.message4": "Buck says the time's all wonky, for one. But now, I also can't shake the feeling that I'm late to something..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.298.message1": "Another clock! Perfect timing. What do we know about these mysterious clocks so far?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.298.message2": "They're not accurate and they keep showing up. Also, they may be causing amnesia. I can't remember the thing I think I'm late for..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.298.message3": "Maybe we could ask Merlin to run some experiments? He's got a whole lab set up for this kind of thing."
  },
  {
    "conversation.298.message4": "No! I can do it! I just need more clocks, a magnifying glass, and three lattes."
  },
  {
    "conversation.299.message1": "Any luck finding out what's up with these clocks, Princess?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.299.message2": "I... I don't understand. They lead to nowhere... and everywhere, a world within a world. What is time if it is not the time that we know?! Where does it go!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.299.message3": "Are you... alright? Maybe you should ease up on the caffeine."
  },
  {
    "conversation.300.message1": "Oh great, another clock. Sleeping Beauty seems a bit wound up herself, lately."
  },
  {
    "conversation.300.message2": "*mutters* Clocks! A clock is very good. Handy for breaking yourself out of a hundred-years long slumber... I mean, if you're in a pinch..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.300.message3": "*whispers* I hope no more clocks show up. They're getting to her."
  },
  {
    "conversation.301.message1": "Hey Buck, I've got one for you: How can you tell a clock is hungry?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.301.message2": "Did someone give you a joke book for your birthday or something?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.301.message3": "It'll go back... FOUR SECONDS. And yeah, you did. Don't you remember?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.302.message1": "Hey, Princess! We know you didn't want us to take these weird clocks over to Merlin's for analysis, but... we wanted to help."
  },
  {
    "conversation.302.message2": "He said, I quote, 'The next time you idiots try to conduct an experiment without me, I will bungle it myself.' He's a real treat, isn't he?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.302.message3": "And?? Does he know where it came from??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.302.message4": "He's working on it. Doesn't think it's from around here, but he did find traces of crumpets on it. Buttered crumpets."
  },
  {
    "conversation.303.message1": "AHA!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.303.message2": "What? What is it??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.303.message3": "I found something that might help Merlin's clock analysis! This clock had a playing card inside of it! A red queen, to be exact."
  },
  {
    "conversation.304.message1": "Tick... tock... tick... tock... We're close to solving the mysterious origins of this clock, I just know it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.305.message1": "The clock isn't from EverMerge at all, it's from Wonderland!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.305.message2": "Oh my! What's happened?! I was just sitting at my writing desk, organizing my scheduler, when... well, I'm not sure."
  },
  {
    "conversation.305.message3": "It's the curse, White Rabbit! It put everyone to sleep and we've been fighting it ever since!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.305.message4": "Oh dear, oh dear... this is not good at all. I'm hours behind now..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.307.message1": "I hate sand. How are we supposed to build Mulan's house with all of it getting everywhere? Also, it's HOT here!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.307.message2": "Look on the bright side, Chuck. We've already got lanterns for a beach bash! And you might get a tan."
  },
  {
    "conversation.308.message1": "How's the build coming, boys?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.308.message2": "We're moving on up! Going vertical with this one. Only the best for Mulan!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.308.message3": "Well, try not to get too starry-eyed. She's just another person like the rest of us!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.308.message4": "A person with multiple awards, sponsorships, and an inspiration to all who meet her... But yeah, just like the rest of us."
  },
  {
    "conversation.309.message1": "You seem to be taking this fog thing well, Mulan. Plus, now there's a whole new island to fix!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.309.message2": "Well, when I woke up from the curse, I realized it was a hard-reset on my training. I get to set all-new personal bests!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.309.message3": "*whispers* It's true what they say, Buck. Exercise does make people unsettlingly happy..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.310.message1": "Looking good! *yawn* Oh, wow. Where did that come from? I guess I've been go, go, go lately..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.310.message2": "Remember the guild's motto, Chuck: To build well, we must first build upon ourselves."
  },
  {
    "conversation.310.message3": "Hmmm... You're right! Maybe I can, uh... 'test' out the sauna we just installed for Mulan."
  },
  {
    "conversation.311.message1": "Mulan, we're looking for a trainer. Would you be up to it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.311.message2": "What kind of training are you interested in? Strength? Cardio?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.311.message3": "Relaxation. You always seem so calm and collected. Please, share your secrets!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.311.message4": "We're just a couple of builders, standing in front of a trainer, asking her to help us relax. Will you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.311.message5": "Uh... I'll see if I can help."
  },
  {
    "conversation.312.message1": "Wow! You're making so much progress on Mulan's build. Huh... where'd you get that smoothie?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.312.message2": "We've been working overtime lately so we're learning how to enjoy the amenities. She has a smoothie station!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.312.message3": "It's about the journey, Princess. Not the destination. Smoothie?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.313.message1": "*clears throat* Um... gnomes? Are you awake? Is there anything I can help with here?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.313.message2": "We're meditating."
  },
  {
    "conversation.313.message3": "Yeah, it's part of Mulan's relaxation training. I keep falling asleep. But I do feel 100% more relaxed."
  },
  {
    "conversation.314.message1": "Oh wow! Is this an in-home theater?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.314.message2": "Mulan says any good training regime includes some down time, so we're browsing her movie collection."
  },
  {
    "conversation.314.message3": "You ever heard of 'How to Lose a Prince in a Fortnight'?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.314.message4": "Ohhhh, that one's SOOO romantic! Scoot over, I'm joining!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.315.message1": "We're all finished here, Mulan! We just wanted to say thanks for all your help training us in the art of relaxation."
  },
  {
    "conversation.315.message2": "We're changed gnomes! We added a couple things we thought you'd like as a thank you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.315.message3": "An indoor track, indoor pool, indoor climbing wall, indoor archery range... we could go on, but you get the picture."
  },
  {
    "conversation.315.message4": "You were great students! Remember: Always take a little time for yourselves."
  },
  {
    "conversation.315.message5": "*sigh* She's so great, isn't she?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.328.message1": "Ah, I love a fresh build in the morning. What do we have on deck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.328.message2": "White Rabbit needs a place. Problem is... he's not adjusting all that well to the surroundings."
  },
  {
    "conversation.328.message3": "He keeps saying he's late and needs to get to Wonderland. But nobody can get anywhere until we lift more of this fog!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.328.message4": "Don't worry. Once he sees the new place, he'll love it! I think..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.329.message1": "What do you think of the place so far, White Rabbit?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.329.message2": "Well, it is a nice little hill to burrow into, but... I don't want to get too comfortable. The Queen will be waiting my arrival elsewhere."
  },
  {
    "conversation.329.message3": "Will she, now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.329.message4": "Of course! And she gets very upset when I'm late!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.330.message1": "White Rabbit keeps talking about this 'Queen of Hearts' and honestly she sounds like a real piece of work."
  },
  {
    "conversation.330.message2": "Yeah! We don't think she appreciates White Rabbit at all!"

  },
  {
    "conversation.331.message1": "Oh, hello White Rabbit! A little bird told me you might like a new teapot for your home."
  },
  {
    "conversation.331.message2": "The birds speak here too? What are they whispering about me? They're liars, all of them!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.331.message3": "Uh, no, what? That was just an expression... I just meant, please enjoy the teapot!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.332.message1": "Whew! What'dya think of the new fireplace? It's cozy city in that burrow now!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.332.message2": "It's lovely, but what about a guest room? The Queen will not be pleased if there's no place for her to stay."
  },
  {
    "conversation.332.message3": "It should be in the shape of a heart and entirely red. She won't stay in any room that isn't!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.332.message4": "*whispers* Seems a bit much, if you ask me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.333.message1": "White Rabbit, you're so worried about making your home nice for the Queen, but what has the Queen ever done for you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.333.message2": "Besides not offing my head? *thinks* Now that you mention it, she didn't even remember my birthday!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.333.message3": "See! She hasn't been a very good friend, has she? Time to put yourself first!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.334.message1": "We were told you might be interested in a permanent card table. Voila! Enjoy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.334.message2": "It's perfect! Oh dear... I used to play quite a lot of card games with the Queen, though. Who will I play with now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.334.message3": "You know, I'm kind of good at Gin Rummy, actually. I mean, if you'd want to play some time."
  },
  {
    "conversation.335.message1": "Fantastic job with the build, my gnomish friends! Wait, what is this thing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.335.message2": "It's called a 'programmable thermostat.' Apparently, you can control the temperature with it. No spells or anything!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.335.message3": "The same temperature... all the time? Scheduled in advance? How delightfully predictable!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.335.message4": "*whispers* I knew he'd like that one."
  },
  {
    "conversation.336.message1": "Thanks for the invite to game night, Rabbit! Who would've thought this little guy could get so competitive about Gin Rummy?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.336.message2": "While 'little guy' seems unnecessary... but yes, you were a worthy opponent."
  },
  {
    "conversation.336.message3": "I'm so pleased you're finally settling in!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.337.message1": "Wow! A castle all to yourself, White Rabbit. How does it feel?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.337.message2": "Well, it's quite an upgrade from my usual hole in the ground. But if the Queen were to visit, I think she would like it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.337.message3": "Still going on about that Queen, then..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.337.message4": "Baby steps, Chuck. His new life on the Cove is just beginning!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_x.message1": "It's been awhile since I've mined, but I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get working!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_x.message2": "Mr. Henry, we could never let you do that. Leave the mining to us. Please, relax."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_x.message3": "But uh, can we maybe borrow one of your special hammers?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x3.message1": "Brakes? Gears? Do we have everything on the list?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x3.message2": "Check and check. We're getting this build on the right track!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x4.message1": "Mr. Henry, could you explain the blueprints to us? Looks like we're building a house, but also a train... is it a house or a train?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x4.message2": "It's both! I want everyone who visits to see the future of EverMerge's transportation with me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x4.message3": "I see... so we WILL want to get that engine, Chuck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x5.message1": "This train-house hybrid Mr. Henry wants to build sure is fancy..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x5.message2": "There's gonna be a snack car attached to the house?! A car just for snacks, Buck! That's way better than a kitchen."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x6.message1": "Have you considered the merits of rabbit hole over train travel? It's always gotten me to Wonderland just fine."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x6.message2": "Ah... But trains are magic unto themselves! Do you see much out the window of a rabbit hole? On a train, you can see the whole world."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x6.message3": "No, well, you do get an eyeful of dirt on the way down... A window would be nice."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x7.message1": "I don't know how we're going to get all this work done!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x7.message2": "Let me give you a bit of advice. You know what a vision is without the will to execute it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x7.message3": "A hallucination. Just think about that, boys."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x7.message4": "*whispers* I don't know what that means, but it sure sounds important."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x8.message1": "Mr. Henry, we put in a display case for your hammers. It wasn't in the blueprints, we just thought you'd like it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x8.message2": "Well you sure hit the nail on the head with that one, boys!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x8.message3": "Mr. Henry, you might be my favorite."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x9.message1": "Great work, gnomes! Wait a minute, you two look different. What's up?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x9.message2": "Well, Mr. Henry told us we should dress for the job we want. So, we put on our best builder's overalls."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x9.message3": "Oh! Hmm... so you're a builder who aspires to be a builder? It's so nice to know what you like."
  },
  {
    "conversation.x10.message1": "*yawn* Have you installed the sleeping car yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x10.message2": "RED ALERT! Buck, where's the emergency espresso? The Princess looks sleepy, and we all know what that means!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.x10.message3": "I've got it right here! Princess, you know how naps are dangerous for you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.xm.message1": "The engine's finally going in!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.xm.message2": "Did I just hear you say you're putting in an engine... into the house?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.xm.message3": "You sure did! Buck, you know what that means. I'm feeling the NEED, the NEED for... a seat belt! Just in case things get rough."
  },
  {
    "conversation.xm.message4": "Of course. Safety first, people!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.xm.message1": "Tada! We're all finished here!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.xm.message2": "Don't you mean CHEW CHEW?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.xm.message3": "Chuck, please don't derail the conversation... Mr. Henry, we took her out for a spin. The engine purred like flooficore!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.xm.message4": "Glad to hear it! Now we can really start exploring. I've got some ideas for new developments..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y3.message1": "How deep are these foundations? They look kind of shallow."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y3.message2": "Uh, regular size?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y3.message3": "Can they stand up to an F5? If the house can't take on 318 mph, this baby will get sucked straight into the sky!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y3.message4": "We'll take a second look..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y4.message1": "Ah... blue skies all day, not a cloud in sight."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y4.message2": "Island life is great isn't it? What made you come out to Paradise?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y4.message3": "No tornadoes. Pretty much."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y5.message1": "You really want this lightning rod in the backyard? Kind of messes up the ambiance."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y5.message2": "Storms have a way of following me around. Better safe than sorry."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y6.message1": "I'm SO excited you're here. You HAVE to tell me all about Oz! Was it anything like Wonderland?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y6.message2": "I don't talk about Oz. You ever seen a witch melt right in front of your eyes? *stares into the middle distance* It's hard to forget."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y7.message1": "Hey, watch the wings! Careful where you're swatting with that umbrella, lady!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y7.message2": "Oh, sorry... I have a thing about flying creatures. There's no, uh, flying monkeys around here are there?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y7.message3": "Well, I have a THING about LAND creatures. So, I don't know. Maybe there are, maybe there aren't."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y8.message1": "I think Tinker Bell is mad at me. I kind of mixed her up with a flying monkey and... it didn't go well."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y8.message2": "Oh, dear! Anger can be a big feeling for her. Perhaps you can try to do something nice for her?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y8.message3": "*Toto barks* Hmm... now that's an idea. Thanks, Toto!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y9.message1": "*garbled screams* What are you doing with that oil?! Get away from me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y9.message2": "I... I just had this friend with a real rust problem! He loved the oil! I thought it might loosen things up??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y9.message3": "Lady, try that again and you'll regret it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y9.message4": "I don't think she appreciated the oil very much, Toto..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y10.message1": "You're going to need a whole lot of juice to power this... uh, well what is this room, exactly?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y10.message2": "My storm watch center. I have several devices in the field to analyze air pressure, wind speed, temperature, humidity..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y10.message3": "Fascinating. And you built all this? Say, do you have any experience with underwater sonar?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y11.message1": "What are you doing, Chuck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.y11.message2": "Tapping my feet together three times to make this build finish faster."
  },
  {
    "conversation.y11.message3": "That's not how that trick works..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.ym.message1": "Tada! What do ya think, Dorothy? Like the house? You know what they say, there's no place like..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.ym.message2": "SHHH!!! Don't finish that sentence! One wrong word and I could end up back in Oz."
  },
  {
    "conversation.ym.message3": "You heard that, magic tornados?! You're not welcome here!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.ym.message1": "I think I'm really going to like this place! *notices witch legs* Oh, shoot... Somehow it happened again, Toto."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x3.message1": "Looks like someone left their hammers lying around again!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x3.message2": "For the last time, someone has to tell Roy to pick up after himself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x3.message3": "Wait a second, these don't look like Roy's hammers... I wonder who they belong to?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x4.message1": "Oh, perfect! More tools to start getting this region in shape."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x4.message2": "These are no simple tools, Princess. These are high-quality hammers!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x4.message3": "Isn't a hammer... a tool?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x4.message4": "*whispers* Just what someone who doesn't understand hammers would say."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x5.message1": "Oh dear, this hammer certainly poses a hazard in the roadway. Gnomes, do we have traffic cones to mark it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x5.message2": "Do we have traffic cones, Buck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x5.message3": "That's a negative, Chuck. The best we can do is other, smaller hammers."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x5.message4": "Oh, no, that doesn't seem much safer..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x6.message1": "Wowie! This hammer's so heavy I can't even pick it up! How are we going to clear it out of here?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x6.message2": "Oh, this thing? It's not too bad. Anywhere you want me to set it down?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x6.message3": "You... you can lift that?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x6.message4": "Have you thought about getting into building, ma'am?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x7.message1": "THIS IS NOT A DRILL, I REPEAT... THIS IS NOT A DRILL. It's a hammer. Ha!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x7.message2": "You about gave me a heart attack, Chuck. I thought we had another loose tornado on our hands. Remember Oz?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x8.message1": "Sturdy and yet limber. Beautiful craftsmanship... Yes, this will be a perfect addition to my toolset."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x8.message2": "We didn't know you were so into hammers, Captain! Interested in joining our hammers appreciation club?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x8.message3": "We call ourselves the Super Smash Gnomes. We're still workshopping the name."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x9.message1": "Sure, that's a big hammer. But my fish hook is even BIGGER!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x9.message2": "I don't know, they kind of look the same size to me?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x9.message3": "Well, that's just what you think! *mutters* No way it's bigger. Ridiculous!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x10.message1": "Do you have any potions in your store good at removing gems from hammers? This one's perfect for a new crown."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x10.message2": "I can turn a hammer into a chicken, but that's the best I can offer."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x10.message3": "Ugh. Thanks anyway."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x11.message1": "I have traveled far and wide to procure such a rare artifact for you fairest maiden. Please, take this token as a sign of my fullest affection!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x11.message2": "Uh... what am I supposed to do with a hammer? Thanks, I guess?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x11.message3": "Hey! You just found that on the beach! They're all over the place!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x.message1": "Hmm, I think I know who this belongs to! Only one hero could wield such a hammer."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x.message2": "We're so close! Just a few more hammers to merge."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x.order.message1": "Good moooorning, folks! Thanks for the wake-up call."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x.order.message2": "I'd just landed in Paradise Cove when all of the sudden... WHAM! Fog. Great timing, right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x.order.message3": "I was just starting to survey this land for a new, high-speed railway..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_x.order.message4": "Sir, can I just say, it's an honor to meet someone with your taste in hammers."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y3.message1": "Oh my! Just what I needed for the beach. A nice pair of sandals! Hm... I wonder if these belong to anyone."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y4.message1": "Hey Buck, what's made of leather, a foot long, and sounds like a sneeze?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y4.message2": "Chuck, there's no time for jokes. We need to focus on picking all these slippers up!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y4.message3": "That's what I'm saying, it's A SHOE! Get it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y5.message1": "What are you doing with that shoe, Maui?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y5.message2": "It's a shoe?! Wow, never seen one so small. I thought it was a tiny canoe for insects."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y5.message3": "Thanks, little bearded man! Hmmm, I wonder if it'd still make a good tiny boat..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y6.message1": "Oh my FOG! Aren't these the cutest shoes?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y6.message2": "Seem kind of impractical to me. Can you even sprint in them?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y7.message1": "Why, I wore a pair just like these to my very first ball! Ah, so many good memories."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y7.message2": "The cake, particularly."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y8.message1": "Yuck! I hate fancy shoes. You'd never wear them on a great adventure!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y8.message2": "Clearly you've never worn heels on cobblestone. Now THAT is an adventure..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y9.message1": "Baba Yaga, is this a new dance you're doing?! Is it called shake-the-shoe? Am I doing it right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y9.message2": "No, child, I'm simply shaking the dust off this slipper... You see? There's a faint yellow powder on the sole."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y9.message3": "Well, I can tell you right now that's not fairy dust. I wonder what it is!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y10.message1": "My word! Has one ever seen a slipper so beautiful? Perhaps it belongs to my one true love."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y10.message2": "I'll search the kingdom high and low for just the foot it fits!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y10.message3": "You do know that's a different story, right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y11.message1": "Not bad... these kind of match my outfit, right? I'm sure whoever these belong to won't miss them."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y11.message2": "Yes, I do believe they do! Or, whatever answer will not turn me into an ice cube."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y11.message3": "You catch on quick, Rabbit."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y.message1": "I can just smell the magic on this shoe. *whiffs* And a hint of lollipops..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y.order.message1": "*squeezes eyes shut* There's no place like paradise, there's no place like paradise, there's no place like... paradise?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y.order.message2": "Wow! It worked, Toto! We made it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_y.order.message3": "Welcome Dorothy! We've heard you've had quite the travels. Please, settle in and explore!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_y.message1": "There's no place like a farmhouse mine to get supplies! Right, Toto? *bark bark*"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z3.message1": "A magical staff! Hmm, I bet someone is missing this one."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z4.message1": "Oh cool! A curvy sword. We could definitely fight some pirates with this!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z4.message2": "That's not a sword, Bell. That's a staff... a combat staff. *gasp* Could it be an enemy?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z5.message1": "One stick, two stick, three stick, more sticks!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z5.message2": "Er, Buck? What are you doing there?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z5.message3": "Just gathering up some firewood, chief. I keep finding these sticks all over the place!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z5.message4": "You might not want to burn those... I think they belong to someone."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z6.message1": "So I was SURE this thing was a rainstick, but I'm not hearing any rain at all. Might be broken."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z6.message2": "Child, did you hit your head on the way out from Wonderland? That's a staff. Not a rainstick."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z6.message3": "Ohhhhhh. Yeah, that makes waaaay more sense."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z7.message1": "Oh dear, these are making such a mess around here!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z7.message2": "*pops out of shrub* Do you think it belongs to a warrior? Our shores are under siege!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z7.message3": "Ahh! Where did you come from? You think we're under attack? My goodness! I need to secure the burrow!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z8.message1": "Mulan is causing a panic again about island security. She seems to think the staffs belong to a warrior."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z8.message2": "Ice Queen here seems to think I'm overreacting. Well, she won't be laughing when her castle's crumbled down to cubes!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z8.message3": "Now, now. Let's not all jump to conclusions. We should give this warrior a chance to speak first! We need to find more of these staffs."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z9.message1": "Coconut helmets? Check. Banana leaf armor? Check. Looks like we have all our gear for the battle, Buck!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z9.message2": "Battle? What's this about a battle? I want in!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z9.message3": "Mulan says we might be under attack. Here, take a helmet. Plus, if you get hungry, there's some coconut inside!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z10.message1": "Where a battle calls, Maui answers! Will you be participating in the fight against the owner of the magical staff?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z10.message2": "Why, I'll do nothing of the sort! Love is the only call I'll answer."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z10.message3": "Huh? Suit yourself. More glory for the rest of us."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z11.message1": "Why is everyone dressed like it's the top of the third act? Is... is that a coconut helmet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z11.message2": "For the battle! For glory! This is EVERMERGE!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z11.message3": "Is this still about the staffs? Oh my fog... People, all they mean is we're getting a new visitor! There's no battle."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z11.message4": "I TOLD them they were all overreacting."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z.message1": "*gasp* I think I know who this staff belongs to! The Princess was right, he's more friend than foe after all..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z.order.message1": "AHHH! We're under attack!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z.order.message2": "*whispers* Dorothy, dear, that's just the Monkey King. Ahem... We're so happy to see you up and about again!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z.order.message3": "What is this babbling about an attack? Have I awoken to chaos?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_z.order.message4": "Sorry, I um, got you confused with some other enemies of mine..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.365.message1": "Look at this hat! What do you think, how does it look?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.365.message2": "I'd stick to the hard hat. Plus, you'd have to get it union-approved."
  },
  {
    "conversation.366.message1": "Another one of these hats!"

  },
  {
    "conversation.o7.message2": "It's lovely, but what about a guest room? The Queen will not be pleased if there's no place for her to stay."
  },

  {
    "conversation.npc_p4.message3": "Honestly, I think it's possessed."

    "conversation.npc_p4.message4": "How strange... it must be very loyal to its owner."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p5.message1": "These sharp hooks could pose a safety hazard if they keep piling up. Do we have any safety cones?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p5.message2": "Did we pack the cones, Buck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p5.message3": "That's a negative, Chuck. The best we can do is other, smaller hooks organized in neat rows. Start gathering!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p6.message1": "What are you reading there, Chuck? Any luck catching something yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p6.message2": "No luck. Just picked up a copy of 'How to Fish' by Will Ketchum. He's a fishing MASTER."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p6.message3": "Let me know what you find out. My belly's only getting emptier."

    "conversation.npc_p.message1": "Princess?! Where'd you get all those fish? You didn't tell us you knew how to throw a line!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p.message2": "Well, I just asked the fish hook nicely if I could use it and off I went! Who wants a fillet?"
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_p.order.message2": "This is the life, isn't it? Water as far as the eye can see and enough fish for a full belly. Now, who's up for some surfing? I could use a stretch."

    "conversation.npc_p.order.message3": "I'm more of a surf the web guy, myself."

    "conversation.use.mn_p.message1": "A boat mine! Now we can really get this island party started. Let's keep working on my boat!"
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.p3.message2": "*whispers* Little bearded men? Is he talking to us, Buck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p3.message3": "Shhh! I don't care what he calls us if he keeps gathering supplies."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p4.message1": "My bearded friends, this boat is much too small. How can I sail the high seas in such a thing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p4.message2": "You just woke up! Why in such a rush to leave already?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p4.message3": "Maui simply can't be tied down! Exploration runs deep in his bones."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p4.message4": "Uh... Well, 'Chuck' will try to pick up the pace. Personally, muffins run deep in HIS bones."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p5.message1": "Captain's area is getting a little cramped. Where are we going to put the navigation system?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p5.message2": "Navigation system! Ha. I don't need one of those, bearded man. All I need is the wind in my hair."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p5.message3": "Huh, seems like that might not be all that accurate? But if you insist..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p6.message1": "Wow! What a wonderful little design. The gnomes really outdid themselves!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p6.message2": "Actually... That would be me who painted it, um, maiden. Y-you really like it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p6.message3": "Oh, yes, it's just lovely! I'm Sleeping Beauty, pleased to make your acquaintance."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p6.message4": "Hey Maui, your face is all pink! I didn't know you got sunburnt. Here, have some of my sunscreen."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p7.message1": "And then you turn this lever on?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p7.message2": "Yeah, just press this knob here and then let it roll and you got yourself a shot of espresso!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p7.message3": "Woah! Didn't know we were installing an espresso machine on the boat. Looking good!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.p7.message4": "I heard the maiden of sleep enjoys this strong wake-up beverage. I hope it'll make her feel welcome on the island."
  },
  {
    "conversation.p7.message5": "Have you met the Princess? She does not do 'at ease.' Good luck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.pm.message1": "What is that delicious smell coming from your boat?! Oh my fog, is that a latte? I thought I'd never see one again!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.pm.message2": "The little bearded men told me it's a drink the mortals enjoy. Please, it's for you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.pm.message3": "It's INCREDIBLE. What's in it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.pm.message4": "A very special, secret island ingredient... *whispers* A little coconut milk."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.pm.message1": "Tada! We're all finished here! Guess you're all ready to hit the waves and SEAS the day, huh?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.pm.message2": "Well, uh, you know, there IS a whole island here to explore. I thought, maybe I can help the maiden fight back some of this fog?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.pm.message3": "Luckily, this thing comes with a dock. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the view!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.pm.message4": "Yeah. And besides, we need your fish hooks around here. Seriously, we can't fish."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q3.message1": "Look at this hat! What do you think, how does it look?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q3.message2": "I'd stick to the hard hat. Plus, you'd have to get it union-approved."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q4.message1": "Another one of these hats!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q4.message2": "That's not just any hat. It's a warrior's helmet... That can only mean one thing: A warrior is hidden somewhere on this island."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q4.message3": "Woah! Where did that sword come from? Were you holding that before?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q4.message4": "If there's a threat on the Cove, we need to seek it out!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q5.message1": "What's going on with Mulan?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q5.message2": "I think her action star mode's activated. She's looking for whoever these helmets belong to... thinks they might be a threat."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q5.message3": "Ohhh, so THAT explains the music that's following her around everywhere!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q6.message1": "Ohhh boy, we've got a warrior incoming. I can feel it. Just look at this helmet!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q6.message2": "That's what I'm afraid of... we've got a possible invasion on our hands."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q6.message3": "Naaah, I wouldn't worry about it! I'd give 'em a little of the old one-two fish and teach 'em quick, if you know what I'm saying."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q6.message4": "I actually have no idea what you're saying."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q7.message1": "AHHH! Mulan, where did you come from? Were you hiding in that bush the whole time?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q7.message2": "The first rule of the hunt is to become one with the environment."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q7.message3": "The only way to discern whether these helmets are hostile or not is through observation."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q.message1": "Just a few more helmets until we discover our new friend. Or foe..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q.order.message1": "Aha! So these hats DID belong to a warrior. The question is, are you enemy or friend? Go ahead, try and make my day!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q.order.message2": "Woah, woah! My warrior days are over. I mean, if you have a demon king that needs slaying let me know how I can help..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_q.order.message3": "I just relocated to the Cove because of all the amazing critters here! Have you seen the parrots? Wow!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_q.message1": "Oh look, a grass mine! Better keep building. I have a lot of pets waiting to move in with me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_q.message2": "Note to self: Remember to add a litter box. Maybe a few of them...?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.q3.message1": "This island's got everything we need for this build!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.q3.message2": "I'm thinking we keep this one easy, breezy, tropical..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q4.message1": "Kintaro, quick question on these blueprints. Says here you want a monkey playground, a zipline park for bears, a kitchen large enough to fit a giraffe... that right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.q4.message2": "Yep! I hope my home will be a sanctuary to all animals on this island."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q4.message3": "Hmm. You might want to consult with Heidi on that one."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q4.message4": "Oh, she knows! She's an old friend."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q5.message1": "You think we can bring in the crane off the main island? We got a whole bunch of supplies here that need lifting."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q5.message2": "Don't think so, Chuck. Too big for the boat."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q5.message3": "Hey, no worries, I can help out.*picks up tree* Where should I put it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.q5.message4": "Wow! Uh, just down the road, thanks. *whispers* Buck, I think we got ourselves a new island crane."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q6.message1": "Not bad, boys! The place is looking good."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q6.message2": "Heidi?! What are you doing off Mystic Isle?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.q6.message3": "Just stopping by to make sure everything's in ship shape for Kintaro's critter residents."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q6.message4": "*grumbles* We know how to build for critters, thanks very much."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q7.message1": "Ouch! Where am I supposed to put these parrots?! One keeps trying to peck me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q7.message2": "These are shadow parrots, they're native to the island... They like to hide! They also don't like you holding them like that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q7.message3": "Chuck, put the bitey shadow parrots in the parrot park. First right on the left."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q8.message1": "What do you think of the panoramic windows, Kintaro? Just installed them."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q8.message2": "They're great! Good place to get a view of any incoming monsters or oni. You know, just in case."
  },
  {
    "conversation.q8.message3": "Does that... happen a lot to you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.qm.message1": "Wow! You know, I wasn't sure about starting over on this island at first but everything looks perfect!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.qm.message2": "A good build just puts a spring in your step, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.qm.message3": "It sure does, Chuck. It sure does."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.qm.message1": "The inside's even better! Now if only I can get the bats and the flying monkeys to stop fighting over the bathroom..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r3.message1": "All these brooms make me think the island's trying to send us a message..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r3.message2": "I'll give you a hint. It's saying: We need to clean up this mess! Chop chop, my gnomish friends!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r4.message1": "Oh my! A broom? This will surely come in handy to keep my burrow nice and tidy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r5.message1": "What's wrong White Rabbit? You look a bit sleepy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r5.message2": "*yawn* These brooms... I took one home to clean up, but it kept me up all night banging on the walls!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r5.message3": "The broom can move?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r5.message4": "It has a mind of it's own!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r6.message1": "Well, it's official. The broom I borrowed has locked me out of my own burrow."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r6.message2": "How did it manage that?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r6.message3": "I've no idea. It must be enchanted! I've never met such a rude broom in my life!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r7.message1": "You still locked out of your burrow, White Rabbit?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r7.message2": "Yes, and the broom has gathered its broomish friends."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r7.message3": "They're now ALL inside my burrow, tapping on the window periodically... I think they're mocking me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.message1": "Ha! Take THAT, brooms! And don't come back!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.message2": "Did you manage to get the brooms out of your house?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.message3": "Yes, I baited them with a little pile of dust. Tricky little brooms!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.message4": "Once I find out who enchanted them, they're going to get an earful!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.order.message1": "Ah, what a pleasant surprise. You've managed to find me. I see you met my brooms?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.order.message2": "Yes, and they were very rude! They kept me up all night AND locked me outside my burrow!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_r.order.message3": "What can I say? My brooms have a mind of their own. Who am I to stifle their self-expression?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_r.message1": "A birch mine! Can't wait to get this build going. What do you think, Baba Yaga?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_r.message2": "I am no judge or juror. The birch will do its purpose."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_r.message3": "*whispers* She's not really the straight-answer type, huh?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r3.message1": "If you don't mind us asking, the whole tropical island thing is new for you, right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r3.message2": "I do mind you asking. But if you must know, winters in the dark forest have grown disagreeble with my knees."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r3.message3": "Ah. Well then, a little sand and sun are just what the doctor ordered!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r4.message1": "Are you two working on Baba Yaga's house?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r4.message2": "Yeah! Wanna get in some choppin' with us?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r4.message3": "Oh, n-no... I'm just making note of her location so I can avoid it. She's absolutely frightening."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r4.message4": "Baba Yaga? No way! She's just a witch who lives in the deep dark forest and doesn't like visitors. *thinks* Huh, I guess when you put it that way..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r5.message1": "Blueprints say she wants a kitchen large enough to 'cook a person' in. Odd way to measure something if you ask me. Never heard of the whole person metric."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r5.message2": "Maybe she meant 'to cook for a person.'"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r5.message3": "Oh, did I? Hmm..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r5.message4": "*gulp*"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r6.message1": "Did you see that? I think that hut just made a face at me, Buck!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r6.message2": "Chuck, don't be silly, a house isn't alive."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r6.message3": "Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that. Everything is in its own way alive."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r6.message4": "*whispers* Let's not talk about chopping wood in front of the house anymore, Buck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r7.message1": "What in the... BUCK! Come quick! There's a chicken leg coming out of this thing!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r7.message2": "No reason to be alarmed, I added it myself. I prefer a... flexible location."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r7.message3": "You mean to say... it can walk? Like, on the leg?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r7.message4": "Naturally."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r8.message1": "Have you seen Baba Yaga? These blueprints don't seem right. There's a room inside a room inside a room. Looks like a trap if you ask me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.r8.message2": "Sorry gnomes, haven't seen her anywhere. I've been looking for a missing chicken. Betsy just disappeared!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.r8.message3": "*whispers* I guess the chicken legs had to come from somewhere..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.rm.message1": "A square chicken?! Tasty. Should we fry it or bake it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.rm.message2": "I wouldn't say that so loudly if I were you. This is a house, not a lunch bar. And it doesn't take kindly to being cooked. "
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.rm.message1": "We were going to set up a whole 'Welcome Home' banner, but the house wouldn't let us inside anymore!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.rm.message2": "Yes, I've been training it to deal with unexpected visitors. You did well, gnomes. For that, I'll give you each a gift."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.rm.message3": "COOL! What do we get?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.rm.message4": "For you, Chuck, an axe sharpener. For you, Buck, a beard grooming kit."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.rm.message5": "*tears up* How did you know?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_s3.message1": "Ice skates? How in the world did these get here, gnomes?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_s3.message2": "Don't ask us! We just help collect them."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_s3.message3": "I wonder who they belong to..."
  },

    "conversation.t3.message1": "Oh dear, it's a bit musty in here isn't it? Perhaps I can give it a good scrub."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.t3.message3": "Cozy, if you ask me."

  },
  {
    "conversation.t5.message1": "Frog Prince, where do you want this poster?"

    "conversation.t5.message3": "*reads poster* 'Never miss leg day.' Hey, you work out?"

  {

    "conversation.t7.message1": "Now that the house is coming together, I thought I'd throw a little soiree!"

    "conversation.t7.message3": "A fete. A shindig. A social affair! A-a... party, gnomes. I just need to gather a few accoutrements..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.t8.message1": "The best thing about fancy parties is the catering. You gonna have any tiny melons wrapped in ham at your housewarming party, Frog Prince?"
  },

    "conversation.t8.message2": "No, something better... voila!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.t8.message3": "What am I looking at here?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.t8.message4": "A mint bar! Spearmint, peppermint, apple mint, ginger mint... one can never be too prepared for... anything."
  },
  {
    "conversation.t9.message1": "Hello, hello! We're here for the housewarming."
  },
  {
    "conversation.t9.message2": "Come in, come in, please! Why, my home has never been as beautiful as it right now with all of you in it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.t9.message3": "Hey, you might want to cool it with the candles, Frog Prince. Think this amount might be a fire hazard."
  },
  {
    "conversation.t9.message4": "Why is the music so... violin-y? And where's everyone else?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.tm.message1": "Nice, Frog-Man! Place is looking great. We heard there was a party. Maui and Rabbit are on the way!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.tm.message2": "H-however did you hear that? No, no, no... this will ruin it all!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.tm.message3": "Ruin what, exactly? What was your plan, Frog Prince?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.tm.message4": "Well, I-I simply believed my one true love might be among you. After all, we're in paradise!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.tm.message5": "Try anything fishy again and I'll turn you into an ice cube."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.tm.message1": "Where has everyone gone? It seems I've missed this little party everyone was going on about. I'm sure my invitation just got lost in transit..."
  },

  },

    "conversation.npc_u3.message1": "Perfect. Just what I was looking for - all this building has me PARCHED."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u3.message2": "Wait, Chuck! You don't know where that... Oh, no. You just drank that potion, didn't you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u3.message3": "What's happening to me?! I'm shrinking!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u4.message1": "Baba Yaga, can you help us out? Chuck drank one of these potions we've been finding everywhere and now... well, just look at him."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u4.message2": "And where exactly is he?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u4.message3": "I've been carrying him around inside my toolbox. It's no magic lamp, but I made a bed out of some palm leaves for him."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u4.message4": "Interesting... Find me more of these mysterious potions. I'll make my assessment then."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u5.message1": "Hey there, where's your little friend? I never see you two apart."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u5.message2": "Oh! He's with me right now. *lifts toolbox* In here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u5.message3": "I see..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u6.message1": "I'm worried about the little bearded man. He thinks his friend is inside his toolbox!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u6.message2": "He could have a case of the sun sickness. Happens on the island. Makes a person crazy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u6.message3": "I knew one of those two goons would crack eventually."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u6.message4": "Now, now! I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding. Let's find him and see what he says."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u7.message1": "Ahem... Hello Buck! What are you doing down there on the ground?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u7.message2": "Oh, just rounding up some potions for Chuck. He's starting to complain about the temperature."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u7.message3": "But Chuck isn't here... is he Buck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u7.message4": "Sure he is! *taps* Right here in my toolbox, of course."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u7.message5": "Oh no, Maui and Snow Queen were right. Buck's lost it..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u8.message1": "We have to do something about Buck! He thinks Chuck is in his toolbox."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u8.message2": "Oh, no... maybe we should get him a pet he can talk to instead? Animals do make the best listeners."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u8.message3": "Or we can just, like, shake him out of it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u8.message4": "So if he's not in the toolbox, where is his friend, anyway?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u10.message1": "*gasp* One of these?! It can't be... oh dear, oh dear... This will surely cause a mess!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.message1": "These enough potions for you, Baba Yaga?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.message2": "Yes, yes... these should be enough. Now, we just mix a little bit of this and a little bit of that... Yes, that should work. Drink up, Chuck!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.message3": "WOWIE! *stretches* Am I glad to be out of that toolbox! No offense, Buck. It's nice and all. But it was starting to get steamy in there."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.message4": "So it was true?! He was in the toolbox the whole time?! I really have to reevaluate my investigation skills."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.order.message1": "Woah... what happened? That was some trip! Did everyone get stuck in the fog or was it just me? That can happen sometimes..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.order.message2": "Alice?! What on earth are you doing here? D-did you... follow me?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.order.message3": "Of course, silly rabbit! Where you go, I go!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_u.order.message4": "Oh, dear..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_u.message1": "Woah! I'm not going near that thing... who knows where it leads."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_u.message2": "The... teapot mine? Don't worry, it doesn't lead anywhere."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_u.message3": "That's what THEY want you to think..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_u.message4": "*whispers* Who is 'they'?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u3.message1": "Have you seen these blueprints, Buck? They're complete nonsense!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u3.message2": "Don't worry, Chuck. I spent a summer building in Wonderland. The rules are just a little different there."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u3.message3": "First things first: Yes, a caterpillar is a unit of measurement."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u4.message1": "Alice, we just can't do it. You can't build a foundation out of sugar cubes here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u4.message2": "But everyone uses sugar cubes in Wonderland!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u4.message3": "I know. But unless you want to be living on a sugar swamp, you might want to reconsider."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u4.message4": "Fine... if you say so. We can do a boring old regular foundation."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u5.message1": "Rabbit, there you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. Why haven't you returned my calls?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u5.message2": "O-oh, haven't I? That's odd... certainly, I never received them."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u5.message3": "Well, don't make yourself a stranger!! I'll be following your tail! Closely! Forever!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u5.message4": "Oh, dear..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u6.message1": "Such an interesting potions collection you have, my dear..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u6.message2": "Oh, I have a potion for everything! Get big, get small, reduce inflammation, grow back a toe. Have you tried essential oils?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u6.message3": "I'd rather not."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u7.message1": "AH! Ahem, my apologies. I thought you might be Alice."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u7.message2": "You're a jumpy one. What's wrong with the new blonde? You hiding from her?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u7.message3": "It's not so much that anything's wrong with her, per say... Awful things just seem to happen to me whenever she's near."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u7.message4": "I nearly lost my head once, you know."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u8.message1": "I thought it would be SO fun if we have a tea party to celebrate my new place! It'll be just like old times, won't it, Rabbit?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u8.message2": "Well that just sounds lovely, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u8.message3": "I... I suppose that sounds nice."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u9.message1": "What a wonderous little tea party, Alice! If I may say, the stories of your beauty surpass even modest expectation."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u9.message2": "Quit it, Frog Prince. Here, I brought ice cream. Where's my seat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.u9.message3": "H-hello Alice. I brought some of my famous tea cakes! Mother's recipe, if you recall."
  },
  {
    "conversation.u9.message4": "Oh YAY! Rabbit, so glad you made it. Go ahead and put them over by the tiny sandwiches. We've got so much to catch up on..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.um.message1": "Uh... what's happening with Rabbit? His face looks three times redder than it should be for an animal of his size."
  },
  {
    "conversation.um.message2": "*muffled garble*"
  },
  {
    "conversation.um.message3": "OH NO! I think he's having an allergic reaction to the tea. Don't worry, Rabbit, I know CPR!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.um.message4": "*garbled screams*"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.um.message1": "Whew, that was a close one, Rabbit. Thought we almost lost you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.um.message2": "I'm NEVER attending one of Alice's parties again!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.um.message3": "How was I supposed to remember you're allergic to licorice? It's like, one of the main food groups!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.um.message4": "*mutters* Never again..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v3.message1": "A clock! Finally, something to tell me what the time is in this blasted place."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v3.message2": "Honestly, how does anyone live with this much sun?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v3.message3": "Not to rain on your parade little man, but this is a compass. A nice one, too. Hmm..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v3.message4": "It must belong to an experienced sailor! Well, not as experienced as me, of course."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v4.message1": "I swear, I saw it this morning! It had a big head and squiggly arms."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v4.message2": "Kintaro here thinks he saw a giant land squid."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v4.message3": "Personally, I think he's just been spending too much time talking to his parrots."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v4.message4": "I'm telling you, it was in a tree! What if we're the first to discover a whole new species?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v4.message5": "Well, these compasses do tend to lead those who use them to certain... oddities. Perhaps it might help you too?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v5.message1": "So, who's coming on the land squid search? I've got a new compass and road snacks."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v5.message2": "Oh, I'm coming, if only to see how this circus ends."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v6.message1": "AHHH! Alice, what the fog were you doing hiding in that shrub?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v6.message2": "I wasn't hiding! I was communing with it. Strangely, the flowers aren't all that talkative here..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v6.message3": "Uh... you haven't seen a walking land squid anywhere have you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v6.message4": "A land squid?! Wow. No, but that sounds très groovy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_v7.message1": "We're going in circles. Either the compass is broken or there's no land squid."

    "conversation.v4.message3": "Big, blue, cold in places? Big fan of sushi."
  },
  {
    "conversation.v4.message4": "The sea is everything! It is a vast desert where man is never lonely, for life stirs on every side of him."
  },
  {
    "conversation.v4.message5": "And thus it has stirred long before his birth, and so it will stir long after his death."

  {
    "conversation.v6.message3": "The plumbing system here is very complex okay!"
  },

    "conversation.v7.message1": "And by the dawn's light, my heart rises for you...' Hmm, no, that's not quite right."
  },
  {

  },

    "conversation.v7.message4": "Give it here. Rubbish! Not a single sea metaphor. Try, 'We two are like islands... separate on the surface, but connected on the deep.'"
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.v8.message1": "Captain Nemo, I've been observing you for some time and have come to the conclusion you're a bullheaded egomaniac."
  },
  {
    "conversation.v8.message2": "And you're an old witch past her expiration date. Shall we play cards later?"

  {
    "conversation.v10.message2": "Ha! My boat is plenty worthy! Wait, is that... is that Tornado FS20?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.v10.message3": "It certainly is. You're welcome to look under the hood."
  },
  {
    "conversation.vm.message1": "Yes... if my calculations are correct, our work here is close to completion!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.vm.message1": "What a wonderful little submarine you've built here, Captain!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.vm.message2": "It is not merely a 'little submarine.' It is a vessel worthy of navigating Mother Nature's greatest weapon: the sea."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.vm.message3": "Now, who'll join me for its first voyage? Perhaps amongst you there is yet a first mate worthy enough."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.vm.message4": "Oh, me me me!! I'll go!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w3.message1": "Oh! What a pretty flower. It's so sparkly! I wonder who it belongs to... doesn't seem native to the island."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w4.message1": "How lovely! I'll gather these up. They would surely make an elegant bouquet... perhaps something to impress our new visitor."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w5.message1": "Hey! Look at this Buck, it's a flower... and a bell! Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w5.message2": "Start a flower bell band? Absolutely. Let's gather up some more bells!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w6.message1": "Those two gnomes have been running around like headless chickens. Have they cracked?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w6.message2": "Haven't you heard? They're starting a new musical project! I think they'll perform soon..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w6.message3": "Oh, goody..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w7.message1": "Little bearded men! What's happening? Looks like you've been picking up all these flower bells, huh?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w7.message2": "Yes siree, we're practicing for our new flower bell band. Still deciding on a name."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w7.message3": "What about the 'Maui Wowies' - nice ring to it, eh?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w7.message4": "We'll, uh, take it into consideration."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w8.message1": "These flowers have SUCH good vibes to them. Wanna meditate with me? Close your eyes... and just listen to the bell ring."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w8.message2": "Alice, I have never meditated in my life."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w9.message1": "A rare flower, indeed... one with unique magical properties. Hmm... I suspect we'll discover their stubborn owner soon."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w10.message1": "Ladies, gentlemen, rabbits... we are the BELL BROTHERS!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w10.message2": "Please, enjoy our new song, 'Ring Me Up Before You Go-Go.' It's a flower bell instrumental."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w10.message3": "Weirdly, this isn't bad. Is something wrong with me?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w11.message1": "The flower bell show went well, I think. Should we put the flutes to rest?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w11.message2": "Never! Diversification, Chuck, it keeps the business running. I'll let people know we do weddings."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w.message1": "You've had your fun, Bell Brothers! But now it's time to get serious. Keep merging! We're close to meeting someone new..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w.order.message1": "How wonderful to see you again Tinker Bell! I hadn't realized you'd left Neverland."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w.order.message2": "Well, I was looking for Peter but I think I aimed a little too far to the right."
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w.order.message3": "In any case, looks like there's plenty of pirates to battle around these parts... like - THAT ONE WITH THE HOOK!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.npc_w.order.message4": "Uh... this is my fishing hook. You want some fish? I can help with fish..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.mn_w.message1": "Excellent! With a fairy wood mine, I can finally start focusing on tinkering..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w3.message1": "Check it out! I made a mechanized hammer that'll keep building even when we're not around! Cool, huh?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w3.message2": "Wow, you're quite the tinker-er - ha! *whispers* Chuck, destroy that hammer. We can't have something doing our jobs."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w3.message3": "On it, sir."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w4.message1": "We need to build on higher elevation! How else am I supposed to spot pirates coming?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w4.message2": "Er... by... flying? With your... wings?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w4.message3": "You really don't know anything about pirates, do you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w5.message1": "A-CHOO! I must be allergic to something in here. Maybe it's all this dust! I guess that's why they call her Tinker Bell and not Tinker Clean-Up-After-Herself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w5.message2": "That's not just dust, Chuck... That's fairy dust."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w5.message3": "Huh, that explains why I keep floating."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w6.message1": "En garde! I challenge you to a duel!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w6.message2": "Oh my fog! Why are you pointing a sword at me?! I just came over to drop off some welcome cookies!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w6.message3": "It's just wooden... don't you want to play? Fighting's the best!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w6.message4": "No way, that's WAY harsh. Peace and love, Bell. Those are oatmeal, by the way."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w7.message1": "What?! YOU live here? I don't want to live in the same neighborhood as an EVIL WITCH."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w7.message2": "Those of your kind do tend to be quite black and white, don't you? It must be exhausting."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w7.message3": "As the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend... at least until they're my enemy."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w8.message1": "There's only one bedroom in this place... where are the rest of the boys supposed to sleep?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w8.message2": "Come again? We've only got one fairy-sized occupant in the blueprints."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w8.message3": "The lost boys, of course! I mean, once they find me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w8.message4": "Hmm... well seeing as they're still lost, maybe uh, let us know when they're found boys."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w9.message1": "AHH! Might someone help? I find myself trapped! I seem to have fallen into some sort of net."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w9.message2": "You walked straight into my booby trap. Name yourself, intruder!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w9.message3": "Intruder?! Why, it is only I, Frog Prince. I come to seek my one true love, could it be you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w9.message4": "Love? YUCK! I think you have the wrong house, buddy. Honestly..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w10.message1": "Interesting contraption you have in here... what is it?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w10.message2": "Oh, that? That's a turboencabulator. Base plate's a malleable logarithmic casing with spurving bearings, if you want to get exact about it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.w10.message3": "Fascinating. Ah, I see the main winding is a panendermic boloid slot! Say, have you ever considered submarine engineering?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.w10.message4": "Uhhhhhh. Yeah, the doo-dad with the thingymajig sure is cool!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.wm.message1": "Yes! This will be the perfect place for adventures, games, and building! Oh, and pirate battles. I think I see one on the horizon..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.wm.message1": "Do you think you'll miss Neverland, Tinker Bell?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.wm.message2": "Me? I don't think so. Neverland always has a way of finding you in the end..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z3.message1": "Have you seen the blueprints for this one, Chuck? Lotta demands for this build."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z3.message2": "Yeah! Golden tub? Silk curtains in every room? A tower that can touch the sky?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z3.message3": "The last time we had such an expensive job it was for King Midas!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z3.message4": "I remember that. Thought I'd never wash the gold out of my beard..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z4.message1": "How's the build coming along?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z4.message2": "Well we've got more of a rustic cave and loose dirt thing going on right now. But don't you worry, we're on it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z4.message3": "One kingdom in the sky coming up!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z5.message1": "Have you heard this Monkey guy can actually fight GODS? So cool. He could probably take down a whole fleet of pirates."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z5.message2": "Hmph. Well he hasn't fought me and won!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z5.message3": "Has he even fought you at all yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z5.message4": "That's beside the point."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z6.message1": "And, you were near death, you say? And slept for 100 years? How troubling."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z6.message2": "I know, right?! Has something like that ever happened to you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z6.message3": "No. I'm immortal and immensely powerful."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z7.message1": "Can you do something about this woman? She keeps hovering around my house asking for one of my paws."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z7.message2": "Uh... Baba Yaga? Is there something we can do to help you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z7.message3": "A monkey's paw is the luckiest paw there is - an immortal monkey's paw even luckier. Besides, he has two of them."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z7.message4": "Have you thought about a nice four leaf clover instead?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z8.message1": "Wow! These flowers are killer. Such a great style choice. Can't wait what to see what you build next!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z8.message2": "You know, I always liked you the best."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z9.message1": "Excuse me? Monkey King gets a fridge with one of those screens that shows you what's inside? What about the rest of us?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z9.message2": "We... we just follow the blueprints!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z9.message3": "*whispers* Don't tell her about the automated shoe rack."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z10.message1": "The indoor gym could use more weapons for training. Is there nothing else in stock?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z10.message2": "We've had a lot of gyms to install lately, so there might not be much left. Anything we can add, Chuck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z10.message3": "We've got several coconut helmets and a pointy stone I found on the beach. Does that work?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.z10.message4": "*sigh* Very well. I'll make due."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z11.message1": "Is this tower high enough for you Mr. Monkey King? The blueprints mentioned 'a tower high enough to reach the cloud highway' - never heard of that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z11.message2": "I believe it's adequate enough to find a cloud for travel. It could stand to be taller, though."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z11.message3": "Oh, wow, didn't even occur to me. Of course! Cloud travel highway."
  },
  {
    "conversation.z12.message1": "Just a few more stones and we'll see something really magical!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.zm.message1": "Excellent! This is the perfect place to start my reign anew..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.zm.message2": "Not so fast! This is more of a group vote kind of place, I'm afraid. Can I get your contact info for our monthly survey?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.use.zm.message1": "Now look at this castle. It's a beauty, Buck!"
  },

    "conversation.use.zm.message2": "Sure is, Chuck. Oh no. Do you hear that crashing? I think we forgot to bolt the bed."
  },
